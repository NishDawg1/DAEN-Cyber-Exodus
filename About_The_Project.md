# Cyber Exodus
This is a repository containing the code and data for the Cyber Exodus' team for the DAEN 690 Capstone course.

# Problem Description:
A major problem facing the cybersecurity industry is that many cybersecurity personnel are leaving, whether that be changing positions or leaving the industry as a whole. Despite multiple initiatives that have been enacted to increase participation and reskill existing workers, the U.S. Census Bureau in 2020 shows a continuous decline in STEM field participation. This is exemplified as the employment rate of Computer and Information Science students from George Mason University in STEM occupations has dropped from 53% to 14% over the last ten years. This project intends to evaluate the exodus of cybersecurity personnel from the cybersecurity industry and identify the causal factors that can be attributed to this migration away from the cybersecurity field. In doing so, this project may provide valuable insights into what factors make a workforce leave.  


# Project Goals
•	Recognizing that detailed data on employment factors may not be available, find proxy data that supports data analysis of factors. 

•	Determine plausable variables and collect proxy data for quality-of-life factors.

•	Analyze data to find insights on potential factor significance that may be influencing cyber security personnel to exit the field. 

# Analysis Algorithms
After finalize the data with factors based on location, housing type, crime, commute, and work enviroment. generated binary stress variables to derive potential stress candidates from job listings (scrapped) data from Indeed(reg) and Glassdoor (Reg).  Used logistic regression, and classification model SVM (linear, rbf, predict) and Kfolds predictive model
